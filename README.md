# APCSA-2025-FRQs

***Solutions written by Shakib Shakh***

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included doing AP classroom quizzes and Albert.io questions.
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were the FRQ specifically the third FRQ question.
- Time management techniques that worked well for me skipping questions I did not know at the moment and coming back to them.
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions I would first read the question thoroughly, if that didn't help me I would write down the scenario of the question and if it had many requirements to function I would write those down too, such as Q4 for the FRQ.

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: My skills in the ArrayList unit are still not as good as my other coding skills.
- Topic/Concept 2: Demorgans Law
- Programming practice: Complete old FRQ question at class/home.

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- **AP Classroom**
- **Albert.io**
- **Previous AP Tests**
- **Mock AP Exams**

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- Hopefully go to a college which specifically focuses towards the computer science field.
- I could build a game where you can create a character and do Competitions against other pregenerated characters similar to Q3 FRQ on the test.
- I plan on studying several days or weeks before my tests in the future because with courses such as computer science it requires a ton of preparation.
